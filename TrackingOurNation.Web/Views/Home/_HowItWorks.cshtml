                        Agenda 2030 is a United Nations initiative, consisting of 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets, to achieve globally
                        sustainable development. New Zealand, in keeping with its reputation as a responsible actor on the international plane, has
                        committed itself to the pursuit and achievement of these goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We noticed that there was little information on New Zealand’s progress and so we asked ourselves, hey New Zealand, how are we doing?
                        Through our dashboard we leverage open government data to seek answers to this question. It all begins with the open government
                        datasets available online. Our platform interfaces with these and voluminous information is retrieved, sanitised and stored in
                        our data warehouse for further processing. From there we extract the relevant data indicators to track and measure New Zealand’s
                        success and progress towards each of the targets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But we didn’t stop there. We wanted anyone to be able to use this platform. To this end we created an API so all kinds of users
                        could access the data to answer the question, how are we doing? We like to think of this as using open data and crowd-sourcing
                        to encourage stakeholder engagement and empowerment for the betterment of all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A final goal is worth mentioning. It is our hope that our system will encourage the population of further government datasets
                        on the open data landscape, in the pursuit of enhanced transparency and open government.
